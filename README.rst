LLODify PanLex
==============

This project tries to put the data of the PanLex project (http://panlex.org/) into the Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud.
To do so the PanLex database has to be triplified. In this case the data won't be converted but translated on the fly.
This is done by the Sparqlify SPARQL-to-SQL rewriting proxy (http://aksw.org/projects/Sparqlify).
